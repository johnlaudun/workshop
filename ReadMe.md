# Hello, there!

Welcome to the GitHub repository for text analysis with Python. If you’re here, you are, or have been or will be, in a workshop with a strikingly similar name, revealing, perhaps, a certain lack of imagination on the part of your presenter. If you like, you can rename the workshop and its materials something more compelling. I recommend *Who’s Afraid of ChatGPT?*, just to keep things interesting and perhaps a bit clickbait-y. 

## Installation

Much, if not all, of the work you will see or do in the workshop will be based in the **Python** programming language. When I began, my principal interest was in text analysis and Python had the most robust libraries. (*Libraries*, aka *modules*, are additional code that offer users convenient access to a variety of functions and functionalities. In addition, the libraries often have a diverse group of people working on them, insuring their utility and stability over the long term.)

There are other programming languages, a number of which offer better, or other, functionalities in one dimension or another, but Python remains a good choice for both novices and masters, as can be glimpsed in recent advanced applications, like ChatGPT, being written in Python. 

In this workshop, we will use a prepackaged version of Python that also comes with a graphical user interface known as Jupyter notebooks. (*Jupyter* is a portmanteau of the three programming languages it supports: [Julia][], [Python][], and [R][] —see note below about *reading the docs*.) Jupyter is widely used in the data science community because it makes it easier to do stepwise coding: you can run single lines of code, “see” the results, and keep going. You don’t have to re-run previous lines of code like you might if you were working with a Python script. 

So, what are you waiting for: go to [Anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com).

In most cases, Anaconda will detect the correct platform and set you on the right path. The download size will vary by platform: the Anaconda download for an M1 MacBook Air runs a little less than 600MB in size (and unpacks to something like 3.5GB). That may seem large to you, but it comes with almost all the functionality you’ll need for most applications *in the box*.

Follow the instructions provided by the installer, and you should have what you need in short order. On our kitchen Windows computer, Anaconda placed a _Launcher_ icon on the desktop. Starting the _Launcher_ opens a somewhat confusing window, but  Jupyter notebooks are an option, and I will be providing users with a notebook from which to work. (It is, in fact, here in this repository.)

### Non-Installed Versions of Jupyter Notebook

If you click on one of the Jupyter notebooks in this repository, it will look just like what you see (saw) in the workshop, but it isn’t an active notebook: you can’t do anything with it. It’s just that Jupyter notebooks are so popular that GitHub went the extra mile and made sure they display nicely when browsing them. There are, however, alternatives to downloading and running Jupyter locally. Anaconda in fact now hosts “cloud” notebooks. As does Google. (Microsoft used to, but they don’t any more I think — but please know that Microsoft is a good open source citizen and offers a terrific development environment/editor, [Visual Studio Code][].)



## Read the Docs

Each of the links accompanying the references to the various languages supported by Jupyter takes you to the documentation for that language. It’s good to get in the habit of, *wait for it*, reading the instructions, or at least the documentation. That noted, the documentation often assumes you know certain key terms, which can make reading it feel circular. There are lots of terrific resources available: Youtube videos; open courseware from MIT, Stanford, and other universities or online education providers; and the much beloved StackOverflow. (And now ChatGPT!)



## Remaining Questions

If you have any remaining questions, please feel free to get in touch. You have my email from the workshop, or you can [post an issue][] here in this repository. GH will send me a notice, and I will follow-up as soon as I can.
