# Installation(s)

While preparing separate installation instructions for Mac and Windows users, I came across [Anaconda], which has the version of Python with which we will be working as well as all the libraries upon which we will be calling. And, perhaps more importantly, it is an _All-in-One_ solution. I downloaded and installed Anaconda on the Mac Mini in my kitchen, and, while it's a large download at 1.25GB, it it does the job. Follow the instructions provided on Continuum.io's site, and you should have what you need in short order. On our kitchen computer, Anaconda placed a _Launcher_ icon on the desktop, which I moved to the Dock. Starting the _Launcher_ opens a somewhat confusing window, but iPython (now Jupyter) notebooks are an option, and I will be providing users with a notebook from which to work. (It is, in fact, here in this repository.)

With that noted, if you are interested in how I install and setup Python on my workhorse laptop, then a complete description is available in the [Mac Installations].

My apologies to the Linux users in the crowd: I just assumed you have enough nerdery to get this done on your own, but do let me know if this is a foolish assumption on my part.
